This is a rickrolling website that was made for a competition under 24 hours.
It consists of 2 pages: 1st, the index page and 2nd, the page to which you will be redirected and where the rickroll video will automatically be played.
The index page contains a form (that does not collect any data and is only front-end based) saying: You Have Won An iPhone 12 Pro Max Give Your Details & Submit The Form.
When you "Submit" the form by clicking a button "Submit" which doesn't actually submit your informatio but rather is just a button redirecting you to the page with the rickroll video.
